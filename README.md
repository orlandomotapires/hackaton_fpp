# FPP Hackathon Repository

## Introduction
This repository documents the results of a hackathon conducted as part of the "Fundamentals of Parallel Programming" (FPP) course. The primary goal of this hackathon was to achieve portability and performance improvements for a sequential codebase through parallelization techniques, utilizing tools like CUDA, OpenMP, and other parallel computing frameworks.

## Tools Used
- **CUDA**: The codebase has been parallelized using CUDA to take advantage of GPU acceleration.
- **OpenMP**: OpenMP directives have been employed for parallelization on shared-memory systems.

## Notebooks
The primary notebook containing all the codes, experiments, and analyses is [Laplacian_Filter_Problem_Hackathon_PT.ipynb](Laplacian_Filter_Problem_Hackathon_PT.ipynb).

## Contributors
- List of contributors and their respective contributions.
